We reached Krakow airport at 23.15 and reached Flower Hostel around 01.30. We met our Barbara and the bus driver who will accompany us during the whole trip. In the morrow we woke up and gathered for breakfast in the very cosy kitchen of the hostel. We had to harry up as we were to travel to the municipality of Kety. As we entered the bus, we were acquainted with Outa, our charming translator without whom the study visit wouldn’t have be possible. Once in the municipality we were welcomed by the mayor and introduced to the city’s heritage and history. We had then a presentation on participative budget and social consultations. The participative budget is an amount of money that is taken from the municipality’s general budget and that is dedicated to the realization of projects suggested by and chosen by the citizens themselves. The participative budget ensures that the citizens do partake in decision making in their own municipalities reinforcing thus the bonds between the people and the authorities. Youth Council and Seniors Council are additional bodies of consultancy and advocacy working with the municipal council. At 12.30 we had our first polish lunch in a nearby restaurant: a very delicious soup, potatoes pancakes with spinach filling and a traditional apple pie. After lunch, we harried back to the municipality where we met the very lively and friendly members of Seniors Council. Senior’s council works on issues that may touch people of an old age in the municipality such as a project where personal medical information of elderly people are put in an envelope within the refrigerator in case a medical unit need this information. Besides, the Seniors Council works on projects which touch the whole community such as organizing events or renovating part of the city.  In the afternoon, we were to visit the Concentration Camp of Auschwitz as a part of our discovery of the country’s heritage and history. It was a very insightful yet extremely emotive experience. The heavy feeling of lugubriousness that weighted on our heart after the visit of museum was only alleviated when we met the genial members of Youth Council of Kety. We had a glimpse on their work, actions and projects as well as their participation in different events.",
        "tripDescription2": "The next day promised to be a long one as we had to travel to Baltow by bus for 5 hours. However the experience was worth the hazards of the travel. The five hours offered us a long time where we could discuss and know each other better since we belonged to different Youth councils. We were also delighted to know more about Poland as Barbara and Outa introduced some of the country’s characteristics. We reached the city and were mesmerized by its landscapes and attractions. After lunch in a restaurant surrounded by hills and forests, we visited the vast Jurassic park of Baltow. We had a very refreshing walk where we were acquainted with the different type of dinosaurs and the history of the place. It was extremely inspiring to see the way a large terrain may be invested in a cultural, educational and touristic activity. We had a presentation by Mr. Jaroslaw Kuba on the way a common village was turned into a touristic destination. Certainly it required remarkable efforts and collaboration between organizations, authorities and citizens as well as effective promotion campaigns and strategies to reach such results. We met then members of Youth Council of Baltow and had a presentation about their work. During the dinner we had the pleasure of conversing with Youth Council Baltow members so as to learn more about each other’s cultures and experiences.",
        "tripDescription3": "The third day in Poland was spent in Miechow city where after lunch we visited the municipality. We were presented to the members of Youth council and to the Mayor. The Mayor delivered a presentation on the city of Micheow, the local development and the participative initiative. He stressed the role of youth council in the decision making and project implementation process. Such a participative approach not only makes citizens more involved in the affairs of their own community but has also positive effects on the implementation and efficiency of the projects. Local development relies on the cooperation and involvement of the citizens. We also met the very charming members of Youth Council Micheow who had a presentation on their activities and actions. We had a walk in the city of Micheow and were invited to visit the church and the art gallery.  We all then left to visit a nearby farm, a magical place where we have spent one of our best afternoons in Poland. The farm provided a cosy space where we had the opportunity to get to know our new friends from Youth council Micheow. We enjoyed few hours of old rustic life and learned a lot about bees and traditional Polish cooking and ingredients. The workshops were all very entertaining: writing with feather quill, cooking.... After dinner we travelled back to the town of Krakow where we were to spend the two final days of our stay.",
        "tripDescription4": "Thursday was Krakow day: we had a very intriguing visit of the city in the morning. After a marvellous and thought-provocative trip to Collegium Maius, we had a walk through the city and a visit to the Wawel Castle. The college is one of the oldest universities of Europe and has preserved its prestigious charm. We were acquainted with the history of the place as well as the history of Poland through the different historical items exposed. One of the marvels of Poland is the specific attention given to preserving the country and the people’s heritage in museums scattered all over the country, cities and villages. We headed then to Embassy of Krakow (Ambassada Krakowian) where we learned more about the organization’s functioning and missions, i.e. how it supports NGOs operating in Krakow. Indeed, the organization has a number of projects among which organizing networking breakfasts at the embassy twice a week: it aims at gathering special people to discuss their experiences and projects. After lunch we met the inspiring RP director of BP Poland who had an insightful presentation on corporate responsibility, strategy and involvement with NGOs. After explaining to us the intrinsic interest of corporations in social investments, we had the opportunity to assess the extent to which our projects would have corporate support. We learned different tips on how to make our projects convincing and appropriate for the companies’ interests. The afternoon was dedicated to a free visit of the attractions in Krakow City: Sightseeing, souvenirs purchasing, and discovering the city.",
        "tripDescription5": "The last day in Poland started with a breakfast at the Flower Hostel. We then moved to the Wiosna Association where we had 3 main presentations. The first one was about Organizing charity campaigns, educational and social programs as well as attracting sponsors. Indeed, the association has several projects which touch different domains and which enjoy a remarkable support from corporations. Among their projects figure Future Academy, an educational program which tries to help pupils in difficulty by assigning private tutors for each. The second presentation was with the Foundation Bureau of Social Initiative and centred on issues of support of local development, public participation, involvement of NGOs and social economy issues.  The third presentation was delivered by Sendzimir Foundation where we learned about their initiatives for the environment, planning and implementation of sustainable development. We learned more about their summer school project as well as their commitment to sustainable development. At 15.00, we left the organization for the bus. It was with a lot of emotions that we bid farewell to our host Barbara and to the city of Krakow for the airport.",

Run by young people for young people, they give young people a voice and enable them to make their views heard in the decision-making process. They give young people the chance to discuss relevant issues, engage with decision makers and contribute to improving the lives of young people within their communities. Youth Councils in Tunisia were initiated in 2013 in 5 localities: Sousse, Hammam Sousse, Kalaa Kebira, M’saken and Monastir in the framework of a ‘Young leaders of local communities of Sousse and neighboring towns’ project implemented By Polish Foundation of Active People and Places, EUREKA Association and Association of Mediterranean Youth for Cultural Exchanges (AJMEC), and supported in 2015 in the framework of ‘Youth Councils in Tunisia’ implemented by Polish Foundation of Active People and Places, EUREKA Association and ‘We Love Sousse’ Association – both projects co-financed by the Polish development cooperation programme of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland. Program ‘Support for Democracy’. Thanks to project implementation a group of youth leaders were delivered knowledge and skills concerning practical aspects of democratic mechanisms on a local level, involvement in sustainable development, participative planning methods.  At the same time they were trained and advised how to build a team, motivate people, be a leader and organize communication and promotion. It enabled leaders to attract young people from the their towns to launch Youth Councils and undertake various actions not only for young people – one opportunity of which was a ‘Youth Initiative’ Competition of mini-projects. The idea of Youth Councils in Tunisia was based on youth councils operating successfully in Poland. In 2015 a ‘Youth Councils in Tunisia’ project was a new incentive to operating Youth Councils as well as to create two more in Hay Riadh and Ksibet El Madyouni. Youth Councils were supported with some more trainings and workshops as well as delivered small grants for mini-projects.

Malgré les conditions climatiques peu favorables à l’agriculture, Hammam Sousse est connue depuis longtemps comme un centre agricole. Toutefois, les plantations d’oliviers ont cédé du terrain ces dernières décennies à cause de l'urbanisation galopante de l'agglomération de Sousse .Le secteur hôtelier émerge dès la fin des années 1970 dans la région de Kanta, qui a pris le nom d'El Kantaoui en référence au saint de la région, Sidi El Kantaoui. Ce territoire accueille de nombreux hôtels et le port de plaisance d'El-Kantaoui. L'activité industrielle se traduit au départ par la présence de quelques unités industrielles dépendant des produits agricoles (meunerie et huilerie) ou des ressources naturelles locales (chaux et briques).",
